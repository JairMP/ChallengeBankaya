1.- The five standard types are:
        - Numbers.
        - String.
        - List.
        - Tuple.
        - Dictionary.
    But they aren't the only ones, they exits some other that have a common use like: 
    float, range, boolean, NoneType, bytes etc.

2.- I think the most difference between tuples and lists is that lists are mutable and 
    tuples are immutable, a list support item assignment and delete items while a tuple 
    does not have this properties.

3.- In python a decorator is a function that another function as an argument and returns another
    function too, decorator are useful when we want add an funcionality extension of a function
    but without make any modification to that function.

4.- A generator is a function that brings a data stream in real time and have each data only when
    we need it in this way we can have a better computer resources managment, for make a generator 
    function we need to use de word yeild that returns data ready to be return.

5.- A deep copy is a copy of one object that is copied into another object it means that any changes made 
    to a copy of the object do not reflect in the original object In the case of shallow copy, a reference 
    of an object is copied into another object it means that any changes made to a copy of an object do reflect 
    in the original object.

6.- Dependecy Injection is a programming tecnique, dependecy injection makes that objects recive another objects 
    it depends on, having a less coupling, making more easy changes to objects and making testing more easy without
    close dependency

7.- First indicate to script python bin:
    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    Second give execution permissions to script:
    chmod +x myscript.py
